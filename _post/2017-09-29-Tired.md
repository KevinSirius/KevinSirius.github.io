The high school is seemingly pointless to me. 
I want to put time into the things I want to learn instead of a learning process that is disturbingly disappointing.
I am saying this not because of the subjects I donâ€™t like or not good at, but the helpless feeling that stings me, like a bee who always bites you on the place you cannot scratch - sometimes on your neck, sometime in your head.
I feel like I am suffering now. I want a break from all of those. ALL OF THOSE.
