The things is, in my emotional world, I can feel when something is happening but I cannot touch it.

Imagine you are blind, seeking for a wall to stand upon.

Suddenly you feel the wind, you tries to escape the direction.

But you fall in.

The endless darkness devours you, hugs you, and locks you forever.

You feel the hole where the wind sneaks in; But you still cannot struggle through the fate.

So.

Imagine you are blind, seeking for a hole to drop down.
