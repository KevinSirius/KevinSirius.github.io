The Yangtze River and the Yellow River are the root of China. The civilization has been developed around the two rivers since thousands of years ago - they breed the farms and provide drinking water, not only being mothers who raise generations after generations of Chinese, but being the God who is willing to sacrifice for their people. And we are talking about the sacrifice part of the Yellow River - people have taken all the bread from Jesus, and they are going for his flesh.

-------

The Yellow River is a long long river - it runs 5500 kilometers to cover 753,000 square kilometers of northern China. It traverses 9 provinces out of 23 in China, combines 35 main rivers and thousands of streams, and provides life support to millions of families for generations.

It has been called "The Yellow River" for a reason: although the river starts in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where the water is clean and clear, the main stream would turn yellow-brown in the middle or bottom of the river.

The problem is the sediment. The river carries away more than 1,600 million tons of sediment every year, as the sediment is mostly composed of loess, a yellow kind of soil.

This kind of soil can be seen common in the area where the Yellow River covers. The physical properties of loess determined its fate - it fails to construct a steady structure when combine with other kinds of soil; it saturates with water very easily; it turns into small grains once it dries, and will be carried away by wind easily with its light weight.

So where does the soil go?

The Yellow River creates more than 18 million square meter land per year with the soil it carries down. Most of the lands are still with unstable structure and cannot be used for farming or planting purpose. The land created is mostly at bottom of the river, jamming the stream by narrowing passageway, which ultimately led to overflow and flood.

-------

But the properties of loess is not the only factor that leads to the spectacular loss of soil. In fact, loess can be fixed easily with plantation since the root of trees or other plants can tighten the soil and generate a structure that cannot be destroyed by the water stream. In the record of history (in China every town will have their own history record written by a certain family, whose mission for generations is to record everything happened in the town), the Yellow River did not take land at such fast rate as today hundreds of years ago, when all the villages are not directly taking water from the Yellow River, but from the branches of it. 
During the time our civilization was mostly built on agriculture, people started to move closer to the river in order to take advantages of its stable water supply, which is always substantial even in the droughty season.
The problem rises when more and more people gathered closer to the edges of the river:
