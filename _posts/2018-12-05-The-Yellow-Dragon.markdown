The Yangtze River and the Yellow River are the root of China. The civilization has been developed around the two rivers since thousands of years ago - they breed the farms and provide drinking water, not only being mothers who raise generations after generations of Chinese, but being the God who is willing to sacrifice for their people. And we are talking about the sacrifice part of the Yellow River - people have taken all the bread from Jesus, and they are going for his flesh.

-------

The Yellow River is a long long river - it runs 5500 kilometers to cover 753,000 square kilometers of northern China. It traverses 9 provinces out of 23 in China, combines 35 main rivers and thousands of streams, and provides life support to millions of families for generations.

It has been called "The Yellow River" for a reason: although the river starts in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where the water is clean and clear, the main stream would turn yellow-brown in the middle or bottom of the river.

The problem is the sediment. The river carries away more than 1,600 million tons of sediment every year, as the sediment is mostly composed of loess, a yellow kind of soil.

This kind of soil can be seen common in the area where the Yellow River covers. The physical properties of loess determined its fate - it fails to construct a steady structure when combine with other kinds of soil; it saturates with water very easily; it turns into small grains once it dries, and will be carried away by wind easily with its light weight.

-------
So where does the soil go?

The Yellow River creates more than 18 million square meter land per year with the soil it carries down. Most of the lands are still with unstable structure and cannot be used for farming or planting purpose. The land created is mostly at bottom of the river, jamming the stream by narrowing passageway, which ultimately led to overflow and flood.

-------

But the properties of loess is not the only factor that leads to the spectacular loss of soil. In fact, loess can be fixed easily with plantation since the root of trees or other plants can tighten the soil and generate a structure that cannot be destroyed by the water stream. In the record of history (in China every town will have their own history record written by a certain family, whose mission for generations is to record everything happened in the town), the Yellow River did not take land at such fast rate as today hundreds of years ago, when all the villages are not directly taking water from the Yellow River, but from the branches of it. 
During the time our civilization was mostly built on agriculture, people started to move closer to the river in order to take advantages of its stable water supply, which is always substantial even in the droughty season.
The problem rises when more and more people gathered closer to the edges of the river:

When more and more farmers started to build branches that runs from the river to their fields, the Yellow River started to have trouble maintaining itself. The level of increasing population around the river cannot be counted as "rapidly," but "exponential."

The increasing amount of need for water drastically reduced the ratio between water and loess, from almost nothing to 3:1, which not only slows the stream speed, but also give more time for the soil to descend, lifting the river bed. The consequence is gradual but disastrous: arid season.

Yes. The Yellow River has several drought season in recent years, because of the unlimited usage of river branching. The worst situation was the total dry land on the river bed.

During the 1970s, with the great development in economy and industry in China, the Yellow River suffered more than expected from human's greed. From 1970 to 1995, the Yellow River had 21 times of completely dry. In 1997, the arid season had been extended to 226 days, which take up 2/3 of the whole year.

-------

Since it is easy to fix the soil by plantation, why not use the plants that are around the river?
Certainly, there were some prairies and bushes around the river, but it was already history.
When the agriculture started to grow around the river area, animal husbandry was also imported.
There were lots of grasslands and substantial water resource, which are all the condition needed to be a heaven for sheeps and cows.

    <p class="post-image-caption">"The flocks in the field near the river"
    </p>
</div>

Over hundreds of years, without maintaining the plantaions, the percentage of green around the river area has been reduced from 38% to 4% today. The flocks of cows and sheeps are already gone, leaving the barron land mixing with the yellow water.

Our greed has built up our future. I can see the flood sweeping out villages, the drought killing the animals and plants. I can see the people running around for help, riot rising up fighting for the precious clean water.

The river is no longer our mother after our greedy abuse. But she used to be.
