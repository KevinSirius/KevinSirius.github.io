I believe that everything on the earth has its meaning.
I just spent ten minutes gazing at the grass. It is waving.
What is the philosophy of it?


I started my school life pretty early and I think that directly affect my ability to feel things. Different books and knowledge stuck in my mind, preventing me from feeling the nature. Or we call it, 0 EQ.

I was born as a mean-to-be-good child. The high expectation from everyone around me - drives me crazy.
