Equipment needed: Weapons, a fencing computer (if I can get one), fencing body cord, Kinect X2, Slow-mo Camera

Ideal: Two people fencing on strip with projector on and camera recording. Will get two outputs: projector will show animation when a touch is made (that's why I need a dark room), and the video recorded will have after effects on.

That's it for now.
