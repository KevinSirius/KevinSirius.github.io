Through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Protestant Establishment sat atop the American power structure. A relatively small network of white Protestant men dominated the universities, the world of finance, the local country clubs and even high government service.


Over the past half–century, a more diverse and meritocratic elite has replaced the Protestant Establishment. People are more likely to rise on the basis of grades, test scores, effort and performance.

Yet, as this meritocratic elite has taken over institutions, trust in them has plummeted. It’s not even clear that the brainy elite is doing a better job of running them than the old boys’ network. Would we say that Wall Street is working better now than it did 60 years ago? Or government? The system is more just, but the outcomes are mixed. The meritocracy has not fulfilled its promise.

Christopher Hayes of MSNBC and The Nation believes that the problem is inherent in the nature of meritocracies. In his book, “Twilight of the Elites,” he argues that meritocratic elites may rise on the basis of grades, effort and merit, but, to preserve their status, they become corrupt. They create wildly unequal societies, and then they rig things so that few can climb the ladders behind them. Meritocracy leads to oligarchy.

Hayes points to his own elite training ground, Hunter College HighSchool in New York City. You have to ace an entrance exam to get in, butaffluent parents send their kids to rigorous test prep centers and now few poorblack and Latino students can get in.

Baseball players get to the major leagues through merit, but thensome take enhancement drugs to preserve their status. Financiers work hard toget jobs at the big banks, but then some rig the game for their own mutualbenefit.

Far from being the fairest of all systems, he concludes, themeritocracy promotes gigantic inequality and is fundamentally dysfunctional. Nowonder institutional failure has been the leitmotif of our age.

It’s achallenging argument but wrong. I’d say today’s meritocratic elites achieve andpreserve their status not mainly by being corrupt but mainly by being ambitiousand disciplined. They raise their kids in organized families. They spendenormous amounts of money and time on enrichment. They work much longer hoursthan people down the income scale, driving their kids to piano lessons and thentaking part in conference calls from the waiting room.

Phenomena like the test-prep industry are just the icing onthe cake, giving some upper-middle-class applicants a slight edge over otherupper-middle-class applicants. The real advantages are much deeper and morehonest.

The corruption that has now crept into the world of financeand the other professions is not endemic to meritocracy but to the specificculture of our meritocracy. The problem is that today’s meritocratic elitescannot admit to themselves that they are elites.

Everybody thinks they are countercultural rebels,insurgents against the true establishment, which is always somewhere else. Thisattitude prevails in the Ivy League, in the corporate boardrooms and even attelevision studios where hosts from Harvard, Stanford and Brown rail againstthe establishment.

As a result, today’s elite lacks the self-consciousleadership ethos that the racist, sexist and anti-Semitic old boys’ network didpossess. If you went to Groton a century ago, you knew you were privileged. Youwere taught how morally precarious privilege was and how much responsibility itentailed. You were housed in a spartan 6-foot-by-9-foot cubicle to prepare youfor the rigors of leadership.

The best of the WASP elites had a stewardship mentality,that they were temporary caretakers of institutions that would spangenerations. They cruelly ostracized people who did not live up to their codesof gentlemanly conduct and scrupulosity. They were insular and struggled withintimacy, but they did believe in restraint, reticence and service.

Today’s elite is more talented and open but lacks aself-conscious leadership code. The language of meritocracy (how to succeed)has eclipsed the language of morality (how to be virtuous). Wall Street firms,for example, now hire on the basis of youth and brains, not experience andcharacter. Most of their problems can be traced to this.


If you read the e-mails from the Libor scandal you get thesame sensation you get from reading the e-mails in so many recent scandals:these people are brats; they have no sense that they are guardians for aninstitution the world depends on; they have no consciousness of their largersocial role.

The difference between the Hayes view and mine is a bitlike the difference between the French Revolution and the American Revolution.He wants to upend the social order. I want to keep the current social order,but I want to give it a different ethos and institutions that are moreconsistent with its existing ideals.
