Hi I am back.

I want to talk about something I don't understand for a long time.
My father don't want me to have the conversation with anyone so I want to spit them out here, for nobody ever accessed this website except me.
This is a serious issue.

WHAT IS OUR GOAL AS A HUMAN?

Or if we break the question down, it becomes: "what should be accomplish as a functional human-being?"

The day before the new year, I watched the last episode of Lianghuan Show. It has a lot of flaws, on its language fluency and content arrangement. But I admired the show. It should be the first Chinese show ever ("Talk Show") that dares to say something about the news hidden by the mainstream media. That episode talks about the things that hurts our dignity as a citizen of PRC while all those media remained silent on those issues.

Then the show is banned.
It is not even a censorship. At least censorship would admit its existance but in a muted manner. The whole show is gone. Vaporized. Disappeared. Whatever you called it.

I always and will not stop laughing at democracy and political correctness. Those things have good impact on human, but in a THEORETICAL WAY. I want to capitalize those letters just to show my disgustness when I ever saw someone overreact to those things. Democracy show the public's opinion in a statistical way, while it also denies others' opposite minds. I read The Three Body Problem four years ago, and the most impressive words were not from the description of Liu's gigantic imagination about the universe and dimensions, but his cruelty to unveil human's dark side when everyone on earth right now thinks they deserve morality and dignity. Don't take my words wrong. I am saying this just because I felt humiliated when someone around me thought the government should do this and that for him while he did not need to pay anything for the government. It is a matter of give and receive. The morality and diginity we are enjoying now are the loot brought by uncountable soidiers who spilled their blood on the revolutions, and it is universal, either in China or USA.

I wrote about those things not to pursuade you to be a so-called patroit, but to put a remainder in your mind that give and receive is always the key. Now the media-industry or culture-industry in China massively produces bullshit everyday and I think China deserves it. As a China citizen, I am deeply sorrowed.

To be honest, I am not angry or sad or something when I am tryping now. I am feeling paralyzed. But I am afriad I will always be, and that fear drives me to write down this.

Another factor is responsible for the tragedy of China's culture industry now - Consumerism. Yeh I know these days everyone who tries to be cool or just dumb blames everything on consumerism; However it is true. Everything JUST followed consumerism hurts my eye. See the "Just" I put? I mean it. There are a lot of examples which successfully combined their independent thoughts with consumerism, and they are flagships. So why does most people still only focus on getting more money while producing their stuff?

Because there are still people seeing it.
China is a HUGE country, and even my capitalized huge cannot express how big it is. Our population ensures most producers have their family fed, which is a good thing, but turns them lazy eventually.

I am tired now and I need to go to sleep.
