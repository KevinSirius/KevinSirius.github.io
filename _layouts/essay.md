"Can I feel it?" I asked myself the question when I look at Andy Warhol's "Triple Elves Prestley."

As a piano player for twelve years, I am always too ashamed to call myself a musician. Musicians are artists but I do not recognize myself as one because my lack in emotions. The first touch
to Beethoven's pieces became a repetitive skill practice. I asked my piano teacher a lot of times "why those sheet music are so boring," and she always responded with a unspoken smile.

I fell in love with computers quickly when I was five. When my father was sending and receiving emails on the bulky IBM computer, the flashing animations always caught my sight. Soonly after
I learnt how to use the bulk - I started my journey on the internet by clicking on the "Microsoft Hearts."

On the Christmas Day in 2008, I bought my first computer science book. It was "Project Examples for C++ beginners." I was wandering around the bookstore, hoping to find another interesting
book to read, and this yellow brick was sitting on the shelf facing me.
